# Face Recognition System

## Overview

This face recognition system is designed to detect and recognize faces using a combination of MTCNN, FaceNet, and SVM. The system extracts facial features and performs classification to identify individuals.

## Workflow

Face Detection: Uses MTCNN (Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Networks) to detect faces in an image.

Feature Extraction: Extracts face embeddings using FaceNet, which maps faces into a high-dimensional space.

Face Classification: Uses an SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier to recognize faces based on the extracted embeddings.

## Source Code 

Soon I will add the jupyter notebook for the same 

## Applications

1.Attendance systems
2.Security and surveillance
3.User authentication

## Future Improvements

Adding Anti-Spoof filter  
Improve accuracy with fine-tuning
Implement real-time face recognition using a webcam
Extend support for multiple faces in an image
